Tyler Mooney, Benji Goldstein, and Tyler Benson
***
* To create executable: javac hw2.java (in directory with hw2.java and Shape.java)
* To run the executable: java hw2
* The output should show several prints for what type of shape the object is
* We sorted on the value of x
* Because this is such a simple program, we didn't have to change anything with our design
* We followed the same previous design but did so with java syntax
* We have one file for the shape class and one file for the main class
